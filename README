COMPILATION
To compile on *NIX, you need the following libraries, including their headers
(Debian/Ubuntu package names are in parentheses):
o asio          (libasio-dev)
o boost         (libboost-dev)
o sdl           (libsdl-dev, or libsdl1.2-dev, etc)
o sdlimg        (libsdl-image1.2-dev or so)
o libgmp        (libgmp-dev)
o OpenGL        (libgl1-mesa-dev or proprietary video driver headers)
o tcl8.5        (tcl8.5-dev)
o itcl3.4       (itcl3-dev)
o tcl-tls       (tcl-tls)
o tcllib        (tcllib)
o libpng        (libpng12-dev or so)
o libpng++      (libpng++-dev)
You also need ImageMagick for building some data files. It is usually found in
a package named imagemagick.

To compile, do
  ./configure
  make

If your OpenGL headers do not supply GL extension functions, instead use
  ./configure --disable-gl21 --disable-gl32
You may also need the --disable-gl32 and possibly --disable-gl21 if your
OpenGL library does not have the necessary functions.

INSTALLING
To install Abendstern, simply run "sudo make install" (or "make install" if you
know you have sufficient privelages to write to $prefix).

Abendstern can be uninstalled with a corresponding "make uninstall".

RUNNING
Run the game simply with the command "abendstern". You will be prompted for
initial settings and which graphics version to run (the default is usually
correct).

The executables understand the following options:
  -H, -Headless         Run without graphics
  -f, -fullscreen       Run in fullscreen mode, ignoring the config file
  -W, -Windowed         Run in windowed mode, ignoring the config file
  -h, -height arg       Set window or resolution height to arg
  -w, -width arg        Set window or resolution width to arg
  -b, -bits arg         Set screen bit-depth to arg
  -c, -cache arg        Only use up to arg MB of RAM for config data
  -F, -Fast             Ignore wall time; assume each frame is 10 ms long
  -prelim               Start in preliminary configuration mode
  -?                    Print usage information
