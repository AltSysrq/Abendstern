COMPILATION
To compile on *NIX, you need the following libraries, including their headers:
o asio
o boost
o sdl
o sdlimg
o libgmp
o OpenGL (at least 1.1)
o tcl8.5
o itcl3.4
o tcl-tls
o libpng
o libpng++

To compile, do
  ./configure
  make

If your OpenGL headers do not supply GL extension functions, instead use
  ./configure --disable-gl21 --disable-gl32
You may also need the --disable-gl32 and possible --disable-gl21 if your
OpenGL library does not have the necessary functions.

INSTALLING
Abendstern cannot currently be installed.

RUNNING
Within the Abendstern directory, run one of the following, based on your
OpenGL version (if in doubt, try the higher version first):
  src/abendsternuxgl32
  src/abendsternuxgl21
  src/abendsternuxgl14

The executables understand the following options:
  -H, -Headless		Run without graphics
  -f, -fullscreen	Run in fullscreen mode, ignoring the config file
  -W, -Windowed		Run in windowed mode, ignoring the config file
  -h, -height arg	Set window or resolution height to arg
  -w, -width arg	Set window or resolution width to arg
  -b, -bits arg		Set screen bit-depth to arg
  -c, -cache arg	Only use up to arg MB of RAM for config data
  -F, -Fast		Ignore wall time; assume each frame is 10 ms long
  -!			(Currently non-functional on UNIX)
  			Don't check OpenGL version, and continue on anyway.
  			(This is the default behaviour on UNIX).
