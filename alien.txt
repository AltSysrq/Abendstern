The alien species of Abendstern is a nitrogen-based, amonia-breathing lifeform. They are only capable of producing vowel-like sounds,
so their language is obviously restricted to these. For the sake of English speakers, the language has been designed to use easily-
pronounceable vowels, and the Romanization is intended to be immediately pronounceable.

SOUNDS
Only seven sounds (five vowels, two semivowels) exist: The cardinal vowels (Spanish A/E/I/O/U), W, and Y. W and Y are actually U and I,
but are used to separate syllables. There is an eighth sound, H, which is only pronounced in some dialects of the language, but also
serves to separate syllables. All contiguous vowels are blended together.

GRAMMAR
All sentences consist of four or fewer terms; a term is usually one word, but phrases can be nested. The maximum structure is shown below;
any number of terms may be left out.
  pre-condition subject object post-condition
If both pre- and post-conditions are missing, the statement is state-of-being.
The function of a word is determined by declining the last vowel (all words in dictionary given in subject form):
  PRE	SUBJ	OBJ	POST
  ai	a	au	ou
  eu	e	eu	ei
  yu	i	ui	ai (if a semivowel is immediately before -i, the pre-condition becomes iyu)
  oi	o	ou	oo
  uhi	u	uha	uye

PRONOUNS
The pronouns and their translations are in the below table.
  ya	I/we
  we	You
  yoi	This/that; what the speaker is thinking of
  wai	Nothing
  wuu	Unknown
  yau	(Only valid as object) The subject

Any pronoun starting with H is special. It is declined according to its current function, with the final subject vowel
of the word from the previous sentence as its base.
