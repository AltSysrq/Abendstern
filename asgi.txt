Abendstern Scripting Graphics Interface

The ASGI is a simple graphics framework, based heavily on the OpenGL 1.x
interface. It allows the scripts to do everything they might need to, and
nothing more.

PRIMITIVE ENUMERATION VALUES
  GL_POINTS
  GL_LINES
  GL_LINE_STRIP
  GL_LINE_LOOP
  GL_TRIANGLES
  GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
  GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
  GL_QUADS

FUNCTIONS
  glBegin enum
    Begin drawing primitives.
  glEnd
    End drawing primitives.
  glVertex float x, float y
    Add a new primitive. MUST occurr between glBegin and glEnd.
  glVertex2f
    Synonym for glVertex
  glColour3f float r, float g, float b
    Same as glColor4f r, g, b, 1
  glColour4f
    Synonym for glColour
  glColour float r, float g, float b, float a
    Set the colour for the next vertex
  glColor3f ...
    Synonym for glColour3f
  glColor4f
    Synonym for glColour4f
  glPushMatrix
    Duplicate the top of the model matrix stack
  glPopMatrix
    Pop the top of the model matrix stack
  glLoadIdentity
    Load the effective identity to the top of the matrix stack
  glTranslatef float x, float y, float
    Same as glTranslate x y (the last argument is dropped)
  glTranslate float x, float y
    Translate the given distance
  glRotatef float theta, float xfac, float yfac, float zfac
    Same as glRotate theta (all other arguments are ignored)
  glRotate float theta
    Rotate about the Y axis by the given number of degrees (degrees
    are used only because radians are inconvenient in Tcl, eg
    [expr (pi/2)]).
  glScalef float x, float y, float z
    Same as glScale x y (the last argument is dropped)
  glScale x y
    Scale in the given directions.
  glUscale fac
    Uniform scale the given amount
    
  glReset
    Resets ASGI. This is an unsafe function. Current drawing operations are aborted,
    and the matrix stack is cleared. This should only be called from the top-level
    Tcl driver script. This MUST be called before ASGI is ready to run correctly.

DRAWING
Drawing works exactly in OpenGL 1.3, given the limited API (begin...end, vertices and colours).

MATRICES
All transforms must effect the same matrix stack used by the rest of the game.
No matrix operation may be called between glBegin and glEnd.
