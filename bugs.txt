1. Semiguided bombs have incorrect power in network play
   Cause: Divides by MBL_POW_MULT instead of the corresponding value
   for semiguided.
   Reproduce: Use semiguided bombs in network play. Best manifistation occurs
   with power level 8, which will kill the client due to a "power" > 9
   Status: Closed 2011.03.04

2. Ships go haywire in network play.
   Cause: Infinite radius due to uninitialized values in accidental "linked list"
     of EmptyCells
   Reproduce: Unknown
   Status: Closed 2011.02.26

3. EnergyCharges appear to small when zoomed out too much.
   Cause: Zoom and the small size of the weapon
   Reproduce: Zoom out and use EnergyCharge
   Status: Closed 2011.02.24

4. Ship verification does not catch cells that overlap very much.
   Cause: Probably FP error and other issues with collision detection
   Reproduce: Use the ship editor to draw a "coil" of right triangles
   Status: Closed

5. Damage does not seem to work against shields in network play.
   Cause: Unknown
   Reproduce: Class B network play, use ships with shields and shoot
   Status: Closed 2011.02.24

6. MonophasicEnergyPulse not yet supported in network
   Status: Closed 2011.03.04

7. Feature: Mark centre of gravity in new ship editor, like the old did
   Status: Closed 2011.03.09

8. ShipEditor does not yet allow making ReinforcementBulkheads stealth-compatible
   Status: Obsoleted 2011.07.23

9. Network protocol does not understand stealth mode.
   Status: Closed 2011.03.03

10. Network protocol does not allow specifying whether ReinforcementBulkhead
    is stealth-compatible.
    Status: Obsoleted 2011.07.23

11. There may be an issue with collision/damage detection.
    Cause: Improvements to collision detection performance (tree->gnome sort)
    Reproduce: Uncertain. Must involve many objects colliding at once
    Status: Closed 2011.03.01

12. ShipEditor has issues with EquTCells
    Cause: Error in collision detection.
    Reproduce: Try to put EquTCells in tight spaces
    Status: Closed 2011.03.10

13. Fandango-on-core in network when a 16-bit ship is fragmented such that a
    new fragment has <= 254 cells but has cell indices >= 254.
    Cause: Ship network type detection does not check whether a fragment should
           be 16-bit despite being small enough for 8-bit.
    Reproduce: See description.
    Status: Closed 2011.05.13

14. Server sometimes tries to access graphics device (calls newVAO()).
    Cause: Unknown
    Reproduce: Unknown
    Status: Closed some time before 2012.01.30

15. Imported missiles do not learn about their target.
    Cause: Unknown
    Reproduce: Use missiles in network play
    Status: Obsoleted 2012.01.30 (that network protocol no longer used)
