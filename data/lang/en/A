 How to create a new translation:
 1. Copy the English language directory (data/lang/en) to a new directory
    named after the new translation (eg, data/lang/es for a Spanish translation).
 2. Follow the translation instructions below for all contained files (eg, A and T).
 3. Add the new language to the manifest (data/lang/manifest) by inserting a line
    containing the same abbreviation used in the directory, followed by the name
    of the language (in that language; eg, Español for Spanish). If the language
    name contains spaces, enclose it in braces (eg, one might have a line
      tkpn      {Toki Pona}
    ).

 Each catalogue file contains a number of language entries. Each line's meaning is
 identified by its first character:
   ~    Declares language
   @    Starts a section
   -    Starts an entry
   +    Adds text to an entry
   *    Adds a new line character plus text to an entry
 Comments start with whitespace or the # character and are entirely ignored.

 When beginning translation of a catalogue, you should start by changing the language
 declared with ~ (usually in the first line) to match the name of the new language
 directory (ie, for Spanish, you would change the first line from ~en to ~es).
 Also change the comments at the top to indicate the long name of the language, in
 English, as well as giving yourself credit for the translation.

 What to translate: Text following a * or +. Line breaks are not inserted with +, so
 it is OK to insert breaks whereever you please, but take care regarding whitespace:
   +foo
   +bar
 becomes "foobar", while
   +foo
   + bar
 becomes "foo bar".

 Trailing spaces should be indicated with \x20 instead of an actual space, for the
 sake of readability.

 What NOT to translate: section and entry identifiers (following @ and -), as well
 as internal colour specifiers (eg, translating \a[(danger)Danger!\a] to Spanish
 should yield \a[(danger)¡Cuidado!\a]).

 Occurrances of string-format specifiers (eg, %s, %.1f) MUST occur in the
 translated text, and without specifying otherwise, must occur in the same
 order as in the English if there are more than one. They can be reordered
 using the syntax shown below:
   English: %s likes %s.
   German: %2$s gefällt %1$s.
 That is, specify the index of the format specifier (the first is 1) followed
 by a dollar sign. Note that some English formats already use this.
 A format element can be deleted (ie, skipped) by using %0.0s .

 In general, preserving the spirit of the text is more important than a literal
 translation. This especially applies to science-fiction terms specific to the
 game, which often would become awkward when translated literally.

 Items for the heads-up-display which are in ALL CAPS should be so in the translation,
 or a rough equivilant of such formatting that suggests a harsh computing environment,
 if the language does not have such letter case. Since HUD space is quite limitted, one
 must keep these translations short. A couple cases have strict character limits; these
 are stated in comments. For those that don't, try not to increase the length by more
 than 25% of the English.

 Keyboard accelerators can be suggested to the GUI by prefixing the appropriate character
 with "\a&" (eg, using "The \a&Button" will cause the GUI to try to use B as the keyboard
 shortcut before T, h, and e).

 The following sequences have special meaning:
 \\     \
 \n     newline character
 \a     Alert character
 \t     horizontal tab
 \xXX   Raw byte, XX is a hexadecimal byte
