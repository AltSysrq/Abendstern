The new ship editor is a C++/Tcl-symbiant system, using libconfig++ as a means of
storing shared information. The C++ side (the "manipulator") handles all actual editing,
while the Tcl side (the "interface") interacts with the user.

The interface is in charge of setting the current mode of the manipulator, which determines
how the latter interprets left mouse-clicks. Certain modes are instant actions, which, after
successful completion, immediately reset the mode to "none".
