# Scripts in this directory are run at startup/shutdown.
# Each script must either do everything it must immediately
# after sourcing, or should
#   $::state setSubState somestate
# to enter an interactive state, or run
#   $::state setCallback description code
# where code returns an integer indicating percent progress;
# the callback will be called once per frame until a value
# greater than 100 is returned.
#
# Each array in this file defines a startup catalogue; the
# strings are both l10n keys for A.boot and names of files
# found under tcl/init.d.
# The boot catalogue is run immediately after Tcl gets
# control, whether or not the program is running in
# headless mode.
#
# After boot is run, bootgraph is run if not headless;
# otherwise, headless is run. In non-headless mode,
# login is run after bootgraph, and whenever new login
# credentials are required.
#
# When the game exits, the shutdown catalogue is run.
