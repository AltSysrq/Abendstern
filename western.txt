The language of the Democratic Union of Western Republics is a fusion of American English and American Spanish. Only differences 
from American English are shown.

Is/Es
Like Spanish, DUWR English has two forms of "be", albeit only in the present tense. "Is" is the equivalent of "estar" in Spanish, 
and is conjugated the same as the English word. "Es" is the equivalent of "ser", and conjugated to "er" for plural.

Articles
All articles (and similar) have plural forms.
  a -> as ("as" as a connector never used)
  an -> anes (replaces "some")
  the -> these
  all -> alles (replaces "all of")
  
'Y':
All syllable-initial 'y' sounds mutate to 'j' (you->jew, yellow->jello).

Jew/Jall (You/Y'all)
Under influence from southern dialect and Spanish differentiation of Ud/Uds, "jew" split into two separate pronouns. "Jew" is 
singular, and receives a singular verb; "jall" is plural and receives a plural verb.

Gender
The word "it" is dropped. All nouns have masculine/feminine gender. For the sake of sanity (since this /is/ a hypothetical language, 
after all), the gender of a noun is determined by these rules, in order of precedence:
  + Ends with -ma: Masculine
  + Ends with -ion: Feminine
  + Ends with -o: Masculine
  + Ends with -a: Feminine
  + Ends with -or: Masculine
  + Finally, if both first and last lettre have no curves or both have curves in their uppercase form, masculine
  + Otherwise (different curve/no curve), feminine
To illustrate the last two rules:
  WORD: W is only straight lines, D has a curve, so feminine
  SHIP: S and D both have curves, so masculine

Conjugation
The English present participle -ing ending fused with -a/e/iendo to become -ingo. This change affects all verbs.
The English past participle (and only in this function) -ed, when a separate syllable, mutates to -ado.
The -er suffix is replaced by -ador.
Conditional verbs suffixed by -ia.

Plurals
Regular English plurals now follow these rules (based on last lettre):
  a -> as
  b -> bes
  c -> ks
  d -> des
  e -> es
  f -> fs
  g -> g(g)es
  h -> hes
  i -> is
  j -> jes
  k -> ks
  l -> l(l)es
  m -> m(m)es
  n -> n(n)es
  ng -> nges
  o -> os
  p -> ps
  r -> res
  s -> s(s)es
  t -> ts
  u -> us
  v -> ves
  w -> wes
  x -> xes
  y -> ys
  z -> zes

Word mutations
Any word starting with 's' plus another consonant has an 'e' placed at the begining.
The -tion suffix is replaced by -sion (-asion after an 's').
"of the" and "of these" are contracted to "othe" and "othese"

Grammar mutations
Short boolean questions with single- or double-syllable verbs are often stated in VOS form, although do-SVO is common for larger 
questions or verbs.
The language often prefers Head-of-Mod construction instead of Mod-Head.
All occurrances of the -er/-est suffices are replaced by more+/most+ for all regular adjectives.
Adjectives have "a" appended if they do not already end in it for feminine nouns.
Occurrances of "wr" replaced with "r".
Generally, German style verbs-with-prepositions are avoided in exchange for one-word alternatives.
Self-references ("myself", etc) moved to immediately before the verb in declarative sentences, and changed to "self".
Adverbs are often not marked with -ly.

Word replacements
The numbers 0--10 are sero, won, to, tree, four, five, sex, sete, ot, dien
All occurrances of "as", "somewhat" (and synonyms) are replaced by "like"
The word "like", when meaning "enjoy", replaced by "gusta" (gusta/gustas/gustingo/gustad/gustado).
"Not" is replaced simply by "no".
"North" replaced by "norte".
"And" replaced by "y" (except in front of words starting with /i/ or /I/ sound)
"Or" replaced by "o" (except in front of words starting with /o/ sound)
"When" replaced by "quen".
"That", "than", and "what" replaced by "que".
